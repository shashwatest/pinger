## How It Works

### WhatsApp Bot Behavior
- **Trigger-Word Only**: Responds ONLY when messages start with `!triggerBotHelp`
- **Silent Auto-Processing**: Automatically categorizes ALL messages but sends notifications only to Telegram
- **Manual Commands**: Full command support when using trigger word

### Telegram Bot Behavior  
- **No Trigger Word**: Processes all messages directly
- **Notification Hub**: Receives ALL notifications from both platforms
- **Full Functionality**: Complete access to all features without trigger words

### Dual Processing System
1. **Auto-Categorization**: Every message is analyzed by Gemini AI for automatic extraction of reminders, memories, and important updates
2. **Manual Commands**: Trigger-word commands for explicit actions and conversations

## Usage

### WhatsApp Commands (Trigger Word Required)
All commands must start with `!triggerBotHelp`:

- `!triggerBotHelp show memories` - View saved memories
